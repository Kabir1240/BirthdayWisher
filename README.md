# Automated Birthday Wisher (AWB)  
-> When you run this program, it will automatically send emails to everyone who has birthdays on that day.  
-> Add birthdays to data/birthdays.csv  
-> When you run for the first time, you'll be asked to create an account. Store your name and email here, for the password, do not use your regular password. Go to your google accounts, set up 2FA, open App Passwords and generate a password from there, use that.  
-> You will not be asked to do this every time. In the future, you can edit this directly from the data/user_account.json. You can delete it and run the program to enter it again via GUI.  
-> You can add more templates, but you would have to modify the source code. Just increase NUMBER_OF_TEMPLATES to the new amount. You can also edit existing templates.
